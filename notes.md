What exactly is a gem? Are the gems we are using hindering us from understanding exactly how some features work by automating some important tasks. Such as the SQL execute method, etc.

Should I memorize each of the common SQL methods we used, like save, self.create, etc?

STUDENTS: If a classmate asks you for help can we be better at not revealing the answer right away but instead try to provide small hints so that they can work it out on there own? Please don't spoil the solution unless it's explicitly asked for.. It helps to arrive at the solution yourself
